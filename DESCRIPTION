Description: 
    High-order functions for data manipulation : sort or group data, given one
    or more auxiliary functions. Functions are inspired by other pure
    functional programming languages ('Haskell' mainly). The package also 
    provides built-in function operators for creating compact anonymous
    functions, as well as the possibility to use the 'purrr' package syntax.
